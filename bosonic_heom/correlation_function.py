    r"""The free correlation function of a reservoir is defined as
        C(t) = < B(t) B(0) >,
    where the expectation value is taken in the thermal equilibrium state
    and B is the bath coupling operator.

    It can be approximately represented as
        C(t) = \sum_j c_j exp(nu_j t) + 2 c_delta * delta(t)
    (for t>0), see e.g. [Kato and Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. (2016)].
    The coefficients c_j and frequencies nu_j may be complex; however, c_delta must be real.

    The correlation functions for baths with some common spectral densities can be obtained
    using the following helper functions:
        * brownian_correlation_function
        * TODO: others
    Additionally, fit_correlation_function can be used for fitting an analytically given function
    with a multi-exponential expression.
